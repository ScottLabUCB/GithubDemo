#Why I love git
The pull request is a universal command. I love git. 
Git is so great because it's as a unit of work, and now this commit that exists is my entire project. 
I can pull it in, just like that. There's no being an outlier. 
All commits are the same. All toons are the same. Everything we build or break down or have to fix are the same things.
