# Github Tutorial

*What are github and git?* 

Git is a tool used to manage the versions of files, mostly code files. It is also a useful tool for collaborating on shared files. Github is a git cloud provider. They offer to store your code, manage permissions and provide additional collaboration functionality like pull requests.

## Setting-up

You'll install git, create an account on Github and set-up security credentials.

### 1. Install Git on Your Computer

You'll follow a few steps to install git. [Full instructions can be found on the git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**Instructions for Mac**

1. Run `git --version` on your terminal. It will install `git` if it isn't already installed.

**Instructions for PC**

1. [Download the Git Shell](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    - This installs the git command line tool as well as a desktop app.
    - The below tutorials will only cover command line tools but the app works well if you want simpler, less-featered git tool.
1. Test that this installed correctly by opening the git bash tool

**An Alternative Install (Mac or PC)**

If you'd like to avoid using the command line you can also use the [Github Git App](https://desktop.github.com/) which provides a UI to use git. I'm not going to cover how to use this tool in the tutorial.

### 2. Setup Git on Your Computer

We'll follow the git setup steps from github. We'll add a [name](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and [email](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git) to git.

1. Open your terminal (Mac) or git shell (PC).
    - You can check that git installed correctly by running `git --version`  which should return a version number.
1. Now you'll add your name. This should be your real name since it will be attached to your code.
    - Run `git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"`
    - For example: `git config --global user.name "Mary Scott"`
    - Quotes are necessary if you have a space in your name
    - Check that this worked by running `git config --global user.name`
1. Now you'll add your name. This should be your real name since it will be attached to your code.
    - Run `git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL>"`
    - For example: `git config --global user.email "mary.scott@berkeley.edu"`
    - Check that this worked by running `git config --global user.email`

### 3. Register for a Github Account

1. Start by creating a Github account. If you already have an acocunt try to sign in again.
    - You're viewing this page on Github and you should find a `Sign Up` button in the upper right.
    - You'll sign-up with an email. It is recommended that you use your Berkeley email since you'll be working on lab projects.
1. You can now fiddle with a few settings if you'd like. Navigate to `Settings` using the dropdown in the upper right.
    - You can add an additional email address (under the `Emails` heading) if you'd like Github to send emails to another address.
    - You can change notification settings (under the `Notifications` heading) if you'd like to get fewer emails. The security alerts in particular can get a little annoying so you may want to uncheck that box.
1. Contact Mary with your github usename so you can be added to the [Scott Lab Organization](https://github.com/ScottLabUCB)

### 4. Set-up SSH Credentials

Whenever you connect to Github from your local computer you need to provide some form of authentication. You have two choices. One is to connect to Github using your Github account password. This can however become cumbersome since you'll have to frequently reenter your password. The second option is an SSH key which requires more setup but doesn't require you to reenter a password every time you interact with Github using git.

[You'll follow the steps from these docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

1. First check if you already have an existing SSH key.
    - Open your terminal (Mac) or git shell (PC). 
    - Run `ls -al ~/.ssh` to list all the files in the `.ssh` folder.
    - If you see a `id_rsa.pub` then you can skip the generate SSH key step.
2. If you don't have a key yet then you'll need to create one.
    - You'll use your terminal (Mac) or git shell (PC) again.
    - Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<YOUR EMAIL>"`.
    - For example `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "mary.scott@berkeley.edu"`.
    - You'll want to use the same email you used to sign-up for github.
    - Press enter 3 times to first confirm creation of the default file (`id_rsa.pub`), assign an empty passcode and confirm the empty passcode.
    - SSH keys can be optionally secured with a passcode but since this key will only exist on your laptop it should be secure enough without a passcode.
3. Now you'll copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to Github. This gives Github the public version of your SSH key so that you can safely connect to Github.
    - Open the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file in a text editor and copy the contents.
    - Go to Github and navigate to [`settings -> SSH and GPG keys`](https://github.com/settings/keys).
    - Click `New SSH Key` and paste in the file.
4. Test that the credentials are setup correctly.
    - You'll use your terminal (Mac) or git shell (PC) again.
    - Go to a directory where you plan to keep code in the terminal. For example run the command `cd ~/Documents` (`cd` stands for change directory and `~` is the home directory).
    - You'll now run a git command to copy code from Github. Run `git clone git@github.com:ScottLabUCB/GithubDemo.git`.
    - You should now see a directory called `GithubDemo` in your folder. For example you can see this by running `ls`.
